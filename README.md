# codes-scripts
Scripts for automating the building/executing processes for CODES, visualizing model graphs, and parsing/visualizing generated statistics.

## Script Files
### build/build-script.sh
* Includes selection flags for building various parts of the CODES workflow (Dumpi, ROSS, and CODES) and running the CODES tests.
* User enters the path to each framework's source directory and desired build directory.

### execution/workflow-combined.sh
* Via selection of a long list of available parameters, this script handles the configuration and execution of codes model-net network trace (with and without background traffic) and synthetic workload simulations.
* Currently supports generation of:
  - Fat-tree, dragonfly-custom, and slim fly network model conf files
  - Contiguous, random, clustered, and hetereogeneous allocation conf files
  - dumpi workload conf files

### job_placement/nodeids-to-rankids.py
* Used within the workflow-combined.sh execution script to convert node ids generated by the clustered allocation algorithm, into rank ids expected for CODES simulations.

### visualizations/cdf-model-msg-stats.py
* Parses MODEL generated output files and constructs CDF plots showing the distribution of performance across all terminals in the simulation for a given metric.
* Supported models and their filenames:
  - Dragonfly:
    + dragonfly-msg-stats
    + dragonfly-router-stats
    + dragonfly-router-traffic
  - Fat-Tree:
    + fattree-msg-stats
    + fattree-switch-stats
    + fattree-switch-traffic
  - Slim Fly:
    + slimfly-msg-stats
    + slimfly-router-stats
    + slimfly-router-traffic

### visualizations/line-sampling.py
* Parses sampling output files generated at the MPI replay layer and constructs time-series line graphs where each line represents the performance over simulation time of a given MPI rank for a given metric.
* Filename used: mpi-sampling-stats

### visualizations/ftree-graph-layout-vis.py
* Parses connection files for the fat-tree model to visualize the simulated fat-tree network layout
* Connection files are generated and dumped inside the lp-io-dir if '#define FATTREE_CONNECTIONS 1' is set at the top of src/networks/model-net/fattree.c
* Currently only single rail/plane configurations are supported
* Supports many different visual representations of the graph including:
  - Layered: Traditional multi-layered fat-tree layout
  - Spring: Spring based approach for spacing of nodes
  - Force: Fruchterman Reingold force directed algorithm for spacing nodes
  - Random: Results may vary
  - Circular: All switches and terminals are arranged in a circle
  - Shell: Arranges switches and terminals in concentric circles
  - Graphviz: Formatted using graphviz utility
