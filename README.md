# codes-scripts
Scripts for automating the building and executing processes for CODES as well as visualizing model graphs and parsing/visualizing generated statistics.

## Script Files
### build/build-script.sh
* Includes selection flags for building various parts of the CODES workflow (Dumpi, ROSS, and CODES) and running the CODES tests.
* User enters the path to each framework's source directory and desired build directory.

### execution/workflow-combined.sh
* Via selection of a long list of available parameters, this script handles the configuration and execution of codes model-net network trace (with and without background traffic) and synthetic workload simulations.
* Currently supports generation of:
  - Fat-tree, dragonfly-custom, and slim fly network model conf files
  - Contiguous, random, clustered, and hetereogeneous allocation conf files
  - dumpi workload conf files

### job_placement/nodeids-to-rankids.py
* Used within the workflow-combined.sh execution script to convert node ids generated by the clustered allocation algorithm, into rank ids expected for CODES simulations.

### visualizations
* Coming Soon...
